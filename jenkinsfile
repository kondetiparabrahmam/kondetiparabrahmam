To push your Docker image to Docker Hub from your Jenkins pipeline, you can modify the previous pipeline script to include Docker Hub credentials and the push step. Here's an updated version of the pipeline:

groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        // Define environment variables for Docker Hub credentials
        DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('docker-hub') // Jenkins credentials ID for Docker Hub
        DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME = 'your-docker-hub-username/your-image-name' // Docker Hub username and image name
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/kondetiparabrahmam/kondetiparabrahmam.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build Docker image
                    docker.build(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME)
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Log in to Docker Hub
                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS) {
                        // Push Docker image to Docker Hub
                        docker.image(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME).push()
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run the Docker container with the web application
                    docker.image(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME).run('-p 8080:8080')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


In this updated pipeline:

- Environment variables are defined for Docker Hub credentials (DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS) and the Docker image name (DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME). Make sure to replace your-docker-hub-username and your-image-name with your actual Docker Hub username and image name.
- The pipeline now includes a new stage called "Push to Docker Hub" which logs in to Docker Hub using the provided credentials and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
- The credentials('docker-hub') function retrieves the Docker Hub credentials from Jenkins credentials store using the provided ID (docker-hub).

Make sure you have configured Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins credentials store with the ID docker-hub (or any other ID you prefer), containing your Docker Hub username and password.

With this updated pipeline, your Docker image will be pushed to Docker Hub as part of your Jenkins pipeline execution.
